# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Null or Empty Array Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to unexpected behavior when dealing with null or empty array inputs.  The `foo` function attempts to access the `length` property without first checking for null or undefined values.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when the function receives null or an empty array as input.  In these cases, attempting to access `x.length` will throw a `TypeError` because `length` is not a property of null or undefined. The provided code attempts to fix the error, but it is not correctly handling cases where x is not an array at all.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking if `x` is null or undefined, and also checking if x is an array before accessing the length property.  This ensures the function handles these edge cases gracefully and avoids runtime errors.
